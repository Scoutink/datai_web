You are a senior creative technologist and UI engineer. Build a complete, production-ready, multi-page **marketing website** for a corporate document management platform called **CMR DMS / DocAI**. The website must be deliverable as a static folder — no build step, no server-side runtime, no package manager. A user must be able to drop the folder on any standard web host or local server and browse it immediately.

---

## PLATFORM CONTEXT

**CMR DMS / DocAI** is an enterprise **Document Management System** designed for corporations, government agencies, legal firms, and compliance-heavy organizations. It helps teams:

- Upload, organize, search, and track documents centrally across category hierarchies. [Manual §2, §5]
- Control who can view, edit, download, or sign each file — down to individual page-level permissions. [Manual §4]
- Automate multi-step approval workflows with graphical progress tracking. [Manual §11]
- Monitor every document action through a searchable, sortable audit trail. [Manual §14]
- Collect documents from external users without requiring them to have an account. [Manual §8]
- Use AI to generate, summarize, deep-search inside, and template documents. [Manual §12]
- Apply digital signatures and text watermarks to PDFs natively. [Manual §7]
- Set recurring reminders tied to documents or events with in-app and email delivery. [Manual §10]
- Manage a directory of clients alongside internal users. [Manual §4]
- Operate the interface in multiple languages for global teams. [Manual §3]
- White-label the platform with the organization's own branding and logo. [Manual §3]

The **target market** is mid-to-large enterprises, compliance officers, legal departments, HR teams, and IT administrators who value **precision, security, and control**. The tone is: authoritative, modern, trustworthy — not playful.

## AESTHETIC DIRECTION

**Theme**: Precision-Futurism. Think the intersection of a Bloomberg Terminal and a high-end architecture firm's pitch deck. Dark background, deep navy to near-black. Sharp typographic hierarchy. Controlled use of accent color — a clean electric teal (`#00C9B1`) or cold blue-white — used sparingly as a highlight, never as a flood fill. Grid-based, structured, but broken deliberately by one or two bold artistic elements.

**Mood board concepts to internalize**:
- CERN / scientific instrument dashboards
- Satellite imagery HUDs
- High-altitude aerospace interfaces
- Architecture blueprints redrawn in light

**Typography**:
- Display/headline font: `"DM Serif Display"` (from Google Fonts) — gives gravitas and a slight editorial edge.
- Body/UI font: `"IBM Plex Mono"` for labels and metadata details, `"DM Sans"` for readable body text.
- Load all from Google Fonts CDN. No fallback to system fonts for display text.

**Color palette**:
```
--bg-deep:        #07090F   /* near-black, primary background */
--bg-surface:     #0D1117   /* card/panel surfaces */
--bg-elevated:    #141B24   /* elevated panels, nav */
--accent:         #00C9B1   /* teal accent — headlines, glows, CTAs */
--accent-cold:    #4F9CF9   /* cold blue for secondary highlights */
--text-primary:   #E8ECF4   /* main body text */
--text-secondary: #7A8599   /* subtext, labels */
--border:         #1E2A38   /* subtle borders */
--danger:         #F04A4A   /* never used decoratively */
```

**DO NOT** use purple gradients, white backgrounds, Inter or Roboto fonts, generic card grids with rounded corners and shadows, or any visual pattern that screams "SaaS landing page template."

**Important**: Every image and video reference in the HTML must use the exact filenames above. Where an image or video does not yet exist (awaiting upload), render a **styled placeholder** with the caption text visible inside it, using CSS only — no placeholder services. Placeholders should look intentional: dark background, thin border in `--border` color, centered caption in `--text-secondary` using IBM Plex Mono. When the real file is uploaded, the placeholder is automatically replaced.

---

## THREE.JS BACKGROUND — SPECIFICATION

This is the centerpiece visual. Implement it in `js/three-bg.js` and mount it on every page.

**Concept**: A deep-space particle field of floating geometric **document fragments** — thin flat rectangles (representing documents/sheets) in a 3D field, slowly rotating and drifting. Some have faint luminescent edges. Behind them, a sparse network of nodes connected by hairline edges (representing data flow and document connections). Everything moves subtly — never stops, never distracts.

**Implementation details**:

1. **Canvas**: Full-screen fixed `<canvas id="three-bg">` positioned behind all content with `z-index: -1`. The canvas must never intercept mouse events (`pointer-events: none`).

2. **Document planes**: Create 60–80 `PlaneGeometry(0.4, 0.55)` meshes (document proportions). Use `MeshBasicMaterial` with `wireframe: false`, semi-transparent fill color in the range of `rgba(0, 201, 177, 0.03)` to `rgba(79, 156, 249, 0.05)`. Add a second wireframe plane slightly larger to suggest an edge glow. Distribute randomly in a sphere of radius 12.

3. **Network graph**: Create 25 `SphereGeometry(0.04)` nodes in teal/blue, connected by `LineSegments` using `LineBasicMaterial` at very low opacity (0.08–0.15). Not every node connects to every other — connect each to its 2–3 nearest neighbors only.

4. **Drift animation**: In the `animate()` loop:
   - Rotate the entire scene slowly: `scene.rotation.y += 0.0003`, `scene.rotation.x += 0.0001`.
   - Each document plane has an individual slow rotation: `mesh.rotation.z += mesh.userData.rotSpeed` (random 0.0002–0.001).
   - Each plane has a gentle vertical float: `mesh.position.y += Math.sin(clock + mesh.userData.phase) * 0.0005`.

5. **Mouse parallax**: Listen to `mousemove` on the window. Smoothly shift `camera.position.x` and `camera.position.y` by ±0.5 units based on normalized mouse position. Use lerp for smoothness: `camera.position.x += (targetX - camera.position.x) * 0.05`.

6. **Camera**: `PerspectiveCamera(60, aspect, 0.1, 100)` positioned at `z = 8`. No controls, no user interaction with the 3D scene.

7. **Performance**: Cap the animation loop to 60fps using `requestAnimationFrame`. On mobile (detect `window.innerWidth < 768`), reduce document plane count to 30 and disable mouse parallax.

8. **Resize**: Handle `window.addEventListener('resize')` — update camera aspect ratio and renderer size.

---

## NAVIGATION — SPECIFICATION

A fixed top navigation bar, shared across all pages (write it once per HTML file). Behavior defined in `nav.js`.

**Structure**:
- Left: Logo (`assets/logo.png`) + wordmark "CMR DMS" in DM Serif Display. Falls back gracefully if logo.png is not yet uploaded (show text only).
- Center: Nav links — Platform, Features, AI, Security, How It Works, Contact.
- Right: Two buttons — "Request Demo" (ghost style, `--border` colored) and "Get Started" (solid teal, `--accent`).

**Behavior**:
- On scroll > 50px: nav background transitions from fully transparent to `--bg-elevated` with a `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` frosted effect and a 1px bottom border in `--border`.
- Active page link has an underline in `--accent`.
- Mobile: hamburger menu that slides in a full-height side panel from the right. The panel has the Three.js canvas visible through it (use backdrop blur, not an opaque fill). The hamburger button and all nav links must be keyboard accessible (Enter/Space to toggle, Escape to close).

### `features.html` — Full Feature Breakdown

Load feature data from `data/features.json` using `fetch()`. Render each feature entry as an alternating left/right layout section — on odd entries, image left + text right; on even entries, text left + image right. On mobile, image always stacks above text. A thin horizontal rule in `--border` color separates each entry. Each block fades in on scroll entry via Intersection Observer.

Create `data/features.json` with the following complete content — do not truncate or omit any entry:

### `how-it-works.html` — Process Explainer

**Section 1**: Hero. Eyebrow: `HOW IT WORKS`. H1: `From upload to audit, fully automated.` Subheading: `CMR DMS / DocAI is built around a repeating loop: organize, control, automate, monitor. Here is how it fits together.` [Manual §1 Quick Start]

**Section 2**: Vertical timeline — 6 numbered steps connected by a vertical teal line. [Manual §1, §3, §4, §5, §6, §7, §10, §11]

1. **Configure your foundation** [Manual §3, §4, §13]
   Set up your company branding (logo, banner, browser title). Define document categories and subcategories that mirror your org chart. Choose your storage backend (local or AWS S3 with encryption). Configure allowed file types and set your SMTP server for email notifications.

2. **Build your team and permissions** [Manual §4]
   Create user accounts and define roles with granular permission sets. Assign users to roles via drag-and-drop. Grant individual page-level permission overrides for edge cases. Add external clients to the client directory for reference alongside internal users.

3. **Upload and organize** [Manual §5, §6]
   Upload single files or batches. Set category, access visibility (Confidential / Public), and lifecycle status (Draft / Final / Archived). Add meta tags for searchability. Assign access to specific roles or users at upload time. Set expiration dates to prevent outdated documents from circulating.

4. **Collaborate, share, and finalize** [Manual §7, §6, §8, §10]
   Share documents with time-bounded access and optional download permissions. Generate password-protected external links. Add comments directly to documents for threaded, contextual discussion. Send documents by email, apply digital signatures, or add text watermarks — all from within the platform. Collect files from external parties via file request links. Set recurring reminders tied to documents or deadlines, delivered by email and in-app.

5. **Automate workflows and approvals** [Manual §11]
   Design multi-step approval workflows with named steps and transitions. Assign each step to the right user or role. Track progress in a visual graph — completed transitions in teal, pending ones in subdued tone. Receive notifications at every transition point. View all workflows organization-wide or filter to just yours.

6. **Monitor and comply** [Manual §14, §15]
   Review the full document audit trail — sortable and searchable by document, user, operation, or date. Monitor login audit logs for security visibility. Check email delivery logs and cron job execution logs for operational health. Apply archive retention policies to auto-delete documents after 30, 60, 90, 180, or 365 days.

**Section 3**: Video block — `assets/demo-workflow.mp4` styled as a dark monitor frame. Placeholder if missing. [Manual §11]

**Section 4**: Two-column comparison — **Before CMR DMS** vs **After CMR DMS** [Manual §2]

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| Documents scattered across emails and shared drives | Centralized, searchable library with category hierarchy |
| Manual email approval chains | Automated multi-step workflows with visual tracking |
| No version control — overwritten files | Complete version history with one-click restore |
| No record of who accessed or modified what | Full audit trail, searchable by document, user, and date |
| External file collection via email attachments | Controlled file request links with type and size limits |
| Compliance reporting done manually | Automated retention policies and exportable audit logs |

Render "Before" column in a dimmer palette with subtle red dash indicators. Render "After" column with teal checkmarks and full brightness.

### `ai.html` — AI Capabilities [Manual §12, §5]

**Section 1**: Full-viewport hero. H1: `Document Intelligence, Built In.` Subtext: `Generate, summarize, search inside, and template — AI built into the document layer, not bolted on top.` Three.js background with conditional pulsing glow sphere activated only on this page: check `document.body.dataset.page === 'ai'` and add a `PointLight` with color `#00C9B1` and intensity that pulses using `Math.sin(clock)`.

**Section 2**: Four feature cards in a 2×2 grid (2 col desktop, 1 col mobile) [Manual §12]:

- **AI Document Generator** [Manual §12 §AI Document Generator]
  Describe a document in plain language. The system writes it in real time, streaming content directly into a rich text editor. Starts in under 2 seconds. Edit, format, and save without leaving the platform. Every generation event — including the original prompt — is stored and retrievable in the AI Document List.

- **AI Document Summary** [Manual §5 — document action menu, §12]
  Select any document already in your library and generate an instant AI summary. Useful for reviewing lengthy files, onboarding team members, or quickly extracting the key points of a policy or contract without reading the full document.

- **Deep Search** [Manual §9]
  Search inside the content of PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and text files — not just filenames or tags. Case-insensitive, with word stemming (searching "approve" finds "approved," "approving"). Returns the top 10 most relevant results. Common stop words are automatically excluded for precision.

- **Prompt Templates** [Manual §12 §AI Prompt Templates]
  Pre-built prompt structures with named placeholders that fill in on demand. Select a template, enter the variable values, and the system assembles the final prompt automatically. Ideal for documents generated repeatedly — NDAs, privacy notices, policy acknowledgements, onboarding letters.

**Section 3**: `assets/demo-ai.mp4` video demo in a styled dark monitor frame. Placeholder if missing. [Manual §12]

**Section 4**: `assets/feature-ai.png` full-width screenshot with CSS `position: absolute` annotation callouts pointing to:
- The prompt input field
- The streaming output area
- The rich text editor toolbar
- The save/export button
Placeholder layout if image missing — show the four annotation labels in a 2×2 grid. [Manual §12]

**Section 5**: `assets/feature-ai-summary.png` — a second visual showcasing the AI Summary action, shown as a half-width image beside a paragraph explaining the use case. Placeholder if missing. [Manual §5, §12]

**Section 6**: FAQ accordion — 6 questions [Manual §12]:

1. **Is my data sent to OpenAI?**
   Prompts are processed via a secured API call. OpenAI credentials are never exposed to the browser. All prompts and generated outputs are stored securely in your own system — not in any shared or external database.

2. **What file types does Deep Search support?**
   PDF, Word documents (DOCX), Excel spreadsheets (XLSX), and plain text files (TXT). Searching is not case-sensitive and matches word variations automatically.

3. **Can I customize prompt templates?**
   Yes. Administrators can create, edit, and delete prompt templates from the admin panel. Templates support any number of named placeholders.

4. **Does AI generation require internet access?**
   AI document generation and AI summarization require connectivity to the OpenAI API. Deep Search operates entirely on your stored documents and does not require any external connection.

5. **Is every AI generation logged?**
   Yes. Every generation event — including the original prompt — is stored in the AI Document List and is visible to authorized administrators. This makes AI use auditable and accountable.

6. **What happens if the AI fails to generate?**
   The system shows a clear error message. Common causes: blank prompt, network connectivity issue, or OpenAI rate limit. Simply wait a few minutes and retry. All errors are logged for admin visibility.

### `security.html` — Security & Compliance [Manual §14, §4, §7, §13, §15]

**Section 1**: H1: `Security Without Compromise.` Subheading: `Every permission, every action, every access attempt — tracked, logged, and auditable.`

**Section 2**: `assets/security-diagram.png` full-width with an animated CSS scan-line overlay — a thin horizontal line that sweeps from top to bottom on a 4-second loop using a `@keyframes` animation. Pure CSS. Placeholder if image missing. [Manual §13 Storage Settings]

**Section 3**: 8 security pillars in a 2×4 grid (2 col desktop, 1 col mobile) [Manual §4, §7, §13, §14]:

- **Role-Based Access Control** [Manual §4 Roles] — Permissions defined at role level. Overridable per individual user for page-specific access. Drag-and-drop role assignment with instant inheritance.
- **256-bit Encrypted Storage** [Manual §13 Storage Settings] — Files stored encrypted at rest in AWS S3 or on your local server. Encryption enabled per storage configuration. A test upload verifies the configuration before it is saved.
- **Complete Document Audit Trail** [Manual §14 Document Audit History] — Every read, write, share, delete, signature, watermark, and version restore logged with user and timestamp. Searchable and sortable by any column.
- **Login Audit Logs** [Manual §14 Login Audit Logs] — Every authentication attempt — successful or failed — recorded with username, IP address, date, and time. Identify anomalies and unauthorized access attempts immediately.
- **Time-Bounded Sharing** [Manual §7 Share Document] — All document shares carry optional start and end dates. Access expires automatically. Revoke instantly at any time.
- **Password-Protected External Links** [Manual §7 Shareable Link] — External sharing links can require a password and expire on a set date. Download permission is controlled independently.
- **Digital Signature Integrity** [Manual §7 Digital Signatures] — PDF signatures are encrypted to ensure tamper-proof integrity. Every signature action is versioned and logged in the audit trail.
- **Automated Retention & Cleanup** [Manual §15] — Archive retention policies automatically delete documents after 30, 60, 90, 180, or 365 days. Deletion is executed by a scheduled cron job and logged in the Cron Job Logs.

**Section 4**: Audit & Logging detail — three-column layout [Manual §14]:

- **Document Audit History** — Search by document name, meta tag, or user. Sort by date, operation, category, performed by, directed to user, directed to role. Click any entry to navigate directly to the associated document.
- **Email Logs** — Track every email sent by the system: sender, recipient, subject, body preview, attachments, and delivery status (Sent, Failed, Queued, Delivered, Opened, Bounced). Error details captured if delivery fails.
- **Cron Job Logs** — Visibility into all 12 automated background tasks: daily notification handler, weekly/monthly/quarterly/semi-annual/yearly reminders, archive retention enforcement, log cleanup, and more. Filter by job name, date, and execution status.

**Section 5**: Two-column compliance callout [Manual §2, §14]:
- Left: Large DM Serif Display text — *"Built for organizations where a missing signature, a wrong version, or an unauthorized view is not a workflow inconvenience — it's a liability."*
- Right: Compliance-relevant feature list with teal checkmarks:
  - Full document audit trail with sortable search
  - Login audit logs with IP tracking
  - Time-bounded, revocable access sharing
  - Digital signature with version and audit logging
  - Automated archive retention enforcement (30–365 days)
  - Password-protected external sharing links
  - Encrypted storage with test-verified configuration
  - Workflow logs for every approval and transition

**Section 6**: Automated Background Tasks — a compact table showcasing all 12 cron jobs [Manual §14 Cron Job Logs]:

| Job | Schedule | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Custom Date Reminder | On demand | Sends reminders on user-defined dates |
| Daily Notification Handler | Daily | Aggregates and sends daily document alerts |
| Weekly Reminder | Weekly | Recurring weekly reminders for document actions |
| Monthly Reminder | Monthly | Monthly deadline and review notifications |
| Quarterly Reminder | Every 3 months | Quarterly document review prompts |
| Half Yearly Reminder | Every 6 months | Semi-annual renewal and review alerts |
| Yearly Reminder | Annual | Annual compliance and renewal notifications |
| Notification Scheduler | Continuous | Coordinates all scheduled notification delivery |
| Send Email | Triggered | Processes all queued outgoing emails reliably |
| Delete Archive By Retention Date | Daily | Auto-deletes archived documents past retention |
| Delete/Archive/Expire By Retention | Daily | Applies retention rules: delete, archive, or expire |
| Delete Email, Audit & Cron Logs | Periodic | Cleans up old log records for performance |

Style this table with IBM Plex Mono, alternating row backgrounds using `--bg-surface` and `--bg-elevated`, teal first-column text, and no outer border radius.

### `contact.html` — Contact / Request Demo

**Section 1**: H1: `Let's talk.` Subheading: `Request a demo or ask us anything.`

**Section 2**: Two-column layout:
- Left: Contact form (pure HTML — use `<form action="mailto:hello@cmrdms.com" method="POST" enctype="text/plain">` and include a comment in the HTML noting "Replace with your server-side endpoint or form service"). Fields:
  - Full Name (required)
  - Company (required)

  - A small note: *"Typical response time: within one business day."*

**Section 3**: FAQ — 5 questions [Manual §3, §4, §11, §13]:

1. **How is CMR DMS deployed?** — The platform is deployed on your server infrastructure. There is no shared multi-tenant cloud. Your documents, your server, your control.
2. **How long does onboarding take?** — Most organizations are operational within a few days. Initial setup involves configuring categories, adding users and roles, setting your storage backend, and uploading your company branding.
3. **Can we white-label the platform?** — Yes. Upload your logo and banner, and set your company name as the browser title. Every user sees your branding from the login screen onward.
4. **Is multi-language support available?** — Yes. Administrators can add, update, and remove language options. The full interface is available in any configured language.
5. **Does it integrate with our existing email infrastructure?** — Yes. Configure any SMTP server (or multiple, with a default) to handle all outgoing notifications, reminders, and document-sharing emails.

## SHARED COMPONENT SPECS

### Scroll Animations (`js/animations.js`)

Use the **Intersection Observer API** — no GSAP required (use GSAP if you choose to, via CDN).

- Elements with class `.reveal` fade in from `opacity: 0; transform: translateY(30px)` when they enter the viewport. Stagger children with `.reveal-children > *` applying increasing `transition-delay` (0ms, 80ms, 160ms, 240ms...).
- Stat counters: When a `.stat-counter` element enters the viewport, animate the number from 0 to its `data-target` value over 1.8 seconds with easeOutExpo easing.
- Timeline items on `how-it-works.html`: slide in from left or right alternately.
- FAQ accordion items: smooth `max-height` transition for expand/collapse. Only one item open at a time.

### Button Styles

```css
/* Solid accent */
.btn-primary {
  background: var(--accent);
  color: var(--bg-deep);
  font-family: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace;
  font-size: 0.85rem;
  letter-spacing: 0.08em;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  padding: 14px 28px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: all 0.2s;
  clip-path: polygon(0 0, calc(100% - 10px) 0, 100% 10px, 100% 100%, 0 100%);
}
.btn-primary:hover {
  background: #00F5DA;
  box-shadow: 0 0 30px rgba(0, 201, 177, 0.4);
}

/* Ghost */
.btn-ghost {
  background: transparent;
  color: var(--text-primary);
  border: 1px solid var(--border);
  /* same sizing and font as btn-primary */
}
.btn-ghost:hover {
  border-color: var(--accent);
  color: var(--accent);
}
```

### Cards

```css
.card {
  background: var(--bg-surface);
  border: 1px solid var(--border);
  padding: 32px;
  transition: border-color 0.3s, box-shadow 0.3s;
}
.card:hover {
  border-color: rgba(0, 201, 177, 0.3);
  box-shadow: 0 0 24px rgba(0, 201, 177, 0.07);
}
```

No border-radius on cards or buttons. The chamfered corner on primary buttons and sharp rectangular cards reinforce the precision aesthetic.
